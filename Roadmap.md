# **RTS Game Development Roadmap - Progress Report**

## **✅ PHASE 1: COMPLETED - Core Architecture Foundation**

### **1.1 Project Setup & Structure** ✅
```
Created Unity 6 project with URP
Established folder structure:
└── _Game/
    ├── Scripts/
    │   ├── Core/
    │   │   ├── Entities/
    │   │   ├── Components/
    │   │   └── Interfaces/
    │   ├── Systems/
    │   ├── Data/
    │   │   ├── ScriptableObjects/
    │   │   └── Enums/
    └── Data/
        ├── Units/
        ├── Buildings/
        └── Weapons/
```

### **1.2 Data Architecture** ✅
- ✅ **ScriptableObject System:**
  - `WeaponData.cs` - Weapon definitions (damage, ROF, range, etc.)
  - `UnitData.cs` - Unit stats and requirements
  - `BuildingData.cs` - Building properties and capabilities
  - `GameEnums.cs` - Centralized enumerations

- ✅ **Core Design Decisions:**
  - Single resource model (Supplies + Power)
  - Faction asymmetry (USA vs Russia)
  - Data-driven architecture for easy balancing
  - Multiplayer-ready deterministic design

### **1.3 Entity-Component System** ✅
- ✅ **Core Framework:**
  - `IEntity` interface
  - `BaseEntity` abstract class
  - `UnitEntity` implementation
  
- ✅ **Component Library:**
  - `HealthComponent` - Damage, armor, death handling
  - `MoverComponent` - NavMesh-based movement
  - `AttackerComponent` - Weapon systems, targeting
  - `SelectableComponent` - Selection visualization
  - `FogRevealerComponent` - Vision system prep

### **1.4 Core Systems** ✅
- ✅ `UnitManager` - Tracks all units by player
- ✅ `RTSCameraController` - Full RTS camera (pan, zoom, rotate)
- ✅ `RTSPlayerController` - Selection, commands, control groups

### **1.5 Current Capabilities** ✅
- Camera controls (WASD, edge pan, zoom, rotation)
- Unit selection (single, box, shift-add)
- Control groups (Ctrl+0-9)
- Basic movement commands
- Attack commands
- Component-based unit behavior

## **🚧 PHASE 2: IN PROGRESS - Resource & Production Systems**

### **2.1 Resource System** 🔄 **[NEXT IMMEDIATE TASK]**
**Goal:** Implement economy mechanics

#### **Scripts to Create:**
```csharp
ResourceManager.cs

- Resource income/drain calculations
- Resource UI events

ResourceNode.cs
- Supply depot/Oil derrick entities
- Capture mechanics
- Income generation

ResourceCollector.cs (Component)
- Harvester unit behavior
- Gather/return cycle
- Automatic resource finding
```

#### **UI Elements:**
```csharp
ResourceDisplay.cs

- Income rate indicator
- Low resource warnings
```

---

## **📋 PHASE 3: UPCOMING - Building & Base Construction**

### **3.1 Building Placement System** ⏳
**Goal:** Grid-based building construction

#### **Core Systems:**
```csharp
BuildingPlacer.cs
- Grid snapping
- Valid placement checking
- Preview visualization

- Rally points

ConstructorComponent.cs
- For units that build
- Build queue management
```

### **3.2 Production System** ⏳
**Goal:** Unit and research production

```csharp
ProductionManager.cs
- Build queues per building
- Progress tracking
- Multi-queue management

ProductionUI.cs

- Progress bars
- Hotkeys
```

---

## **📋 PHASE 4: UPCOMING - Combat & Weapons**

### **4.1 Advanced Combat** ⏳
```csharp

2. Create `ResourceNode.cs`
3. Create supply depot prefab
4. Test resource gathering

### **Day 2: Building System**
1. Create `BuildingPlacer.cs`
2. Create grid visualization
3. Create first building prefabs
4. Test placement mechanics

### **Day 3: Production**
1. Create `ProductionManager.cs`
2. Create Barracks building
3. Implement unit spawning
4. Create build queue UI

### **Day 4: Combat Polish**
1. Create projectile system
2. Add weapon effects
3. Create damage tables
4. Add death animations

### **Day 5: Integration**
1. Connect all systems
2. Create first complete gameplay loop

---

## **Success Metrics for Phase 2:**
- [ ] Players can gather resources
- [ ] Resource UI updates in real-time  
- [ ] Buildings cost and consume resources
- [ ] Units can be produced from buildings
- [ ] Full economic gameplay loop works

## **Current Tech Debt to Address:**
1. Need to implement object pooling for performance
2. Need to add save/load system eventually
3. Need proper error handling in managers
4. Need unit tests for core systems

---

**What would you like to tackle next?**
1. **Option A:** Continue with Resource System (recommended)
2. **Option B:** Jump to Building Placement
3. **Option C:** Polish current systems first
4. **Option D:** Add basic UI/HUD elements
